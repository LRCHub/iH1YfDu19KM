[00:11.53] One day, I'll change my ways
[00:14.38] 'Til then I'm stuck in this space
[00:17.14] Shut down and hiding my face
[00:19.10] Tuned out and losing my faith
[00:33.60] 
[00:21.73] Stand up, tired of being a victim
[00:24.05] You only on the outs if you with 'em
[00:26.59] Only hurts if you give 'em credence (uh)
[00:28.96] Give 'em reasons (uh)
[00:30.13] They're not better than you
[00:31.34] They're just a figment of imagination
[00:49.84] 
[00:34.08] There are times when I don't like myself
[00:39.76] I believe all the things that they say about me
[00:44.95] I wanna love myself, just like everyone else
[00:50.38] But there are times when I don't like myself
[01:12.38] 
[00:55.72] This life is beating me down
[00:58.51] But karma is coming around
[01:01.52] Tongue-tied, and you got the best of me
[01:04.14] A nightmare that's filling my dreams
[01:22.14] 
[01:06.36] Stand up, tired of being a victim
[01:08.52] You only on the outs if you with 'em
[01:10.83] Only hurts if you give 'em credence (uh)
[01:13.33] Give 'em reasons (uh)
[01:14.41] They're not better than you
[01:15.98] They're just a figment of imagination
[01:34.48] 
[01:18.42] There are times when I don't like myself (there are times)
[01:24.03] I believe all the things that they say about me (about me)
[01:29.33] I wanna love myself, just like everyone else
[01:34.69] But there are times when I don't like myself
[01:56.69] 
[01:40.55] I, da-da, da-da, I don't like myself
[01:46.29] I, da-da, da-da, I don't like myself
[02:04.29] 
[01:51.74] I'll walk through fire for this
[01:57.50] I will be the one to turn this car around
[02:01.57] 'Cause it's headed for disaster
[02:04.69] No happily ever after
[02:07.48] And I've got so much more to live for
[02:10.70] Than what you think of me
[02:23.20] 
[02:13.73] There are times when I don't like myself (there are times)
[02:19.48] I believe all the things that they say about me (about me)
[02:24.67] I wanna love myself, just like everyone else
[02:30.36] But there are times when I don't like myself
[02:52.36] 
[02:36.01] I, da-da, da-da, I don't like myself
[02:41.75] I, da-da, da-da, I don't like myself
[02:47.23] I, da-da, da-da-da, I don't (I, da) li-li-li-li-like myself
[02:54.18] I, da, like myself
[02:57.01] I, da, like myself
[02:59.65] I, da, like myself
