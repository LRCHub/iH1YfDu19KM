It broke my heart
When you were gone
So much went wrong
Right from day one

I don't like myself
I want to be someone else
I don't trust myself
I want to be someone else

It made me wonder
It made me regret
Each day is a struggle
But I must carry on
Carry on

The battle wounds on my arm
It seems so wrong
The things I can't explain
The actions always will remain

I don't like myself
I want to be someone else
I don't trust myself
I want to be someone else, someone else
Someone else

In case you wonder
I am bleeding here to death
No one said it was easy
To put it all to rest

I don't like myself
I want to be someone else
I don't like myself
I don't trust no one else
No one else, no one else
