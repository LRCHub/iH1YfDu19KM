[00:11.55] One day, I'll change my ways
[00:14.31] 'Til then I'm stuck in this space
[00:17.13] Shut down and hiding my face
[00:19.92] Tuned out and losing my faith
[00:34.42] 
[00:21.78] Stand up, tired of being a victim
[00:24.09] You only on the outs if you with 'em
[00:26.60] Only hurts if you give 'em credence (uh)
[00:28.99] Give 'em reasons (uh)
[00:30.12] They're not better than you
[00:31.34] They're just a figment of imagination
[00:49.84] 
[00:34.08] There are times when I don't like myself
[00:39.76] I believe all the things that they say about me
[00:44.94] I wanna love myself, just like everyone else
[00:50.31] But there are times when I don't like myself
[01:12.31] 
[00:55.79] This life is beating me down
[00:58.52] But karma is coming around
[01:01.59] Tongue-tied, and you got the best of me
[01:04.15] A nightmare that's filling my dreams
[01:22.15] 
[01:06.32] Stand up, tired of being a victim
[01:08.51] You only on the outs if you with 'em
[01:10.83] Only hurts if you give 'em credence (uh)
[01:13.39] Give 'em reasons (uh)
[01:14.47] They're not better than you
[01:15.96] They're just a figment of imagination
[01:34.46] 
[01:18.44] There are times when I don't like myself (there are times)
[01:24.02] I believe all the things that they say about me (about me)
[01:29.35] I wanna love myself, just like everyone else
[01:34.61] But there are times when I don't like myself
[01:56.61] 
[01:40.58] I, da-da, da-da, I don't like myself
[01:46.26] I, da-da, da-da, I don't like myself
[02:04.26] 
[01:51.78] I'll walk through fire for this
[01:57.44] I will be the one to turn this car around
[02:01.58] 'Cause it's headed for disaster
[02:04.63] No happily ever after
[02:07.45] And I've got so much more to live for
[02:10.76] Than what you think of me
[02:23.26] 
[02:13.71] There are times when I don't like myself (there are times)
[02:19.46] I believe all the things that they say about me (about me)
[02:24.66] I wanna love myself, just like everyone else
[02:30.33] But there are times when I don't like myself
[02:52.33] 
[02:36.08] I, da-da, da-da, I don't like myself
[02:41.75] I, da-da, da-da, I don't like myself
[02:47.30] I, da-da, da-da-da, I don't (I, da) li-li-li-li-like myself
[02:54.13] I, da, like myself
[02:57.04] I, da, like myself
[02:59.68] I, da, like myself
